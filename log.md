**Today's Progress:** Code Challenges

**Thoughts:** These were fun! I liked my first solution a lot. The second one was a bit more challenging and I had to do some research. Some takeaways for me are that I am interested in learning more about what a radix is and I'd like to try using while loops more in challenges.
